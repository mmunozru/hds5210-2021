Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Overall, nice work on putting the final together.  You did some great work merging different data sources together to create a final dataset that could give you some interesting insights.

One thing that kept throwing me was that your dependent variable you were exploring was simply called "Data_Value".  I had to keep thinking about what this data value we're talking about meant.  It would have it called "heart disease mortality."
